# Hi there, I'm Siddhant Choudhary! 👋

### 🎓 Computer Science & Mathematics @ UW-Madison

I am a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing a double major in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**. 

I am a product-minded engineer with a strong foundation in **applied mathematics** and **infrastructure**. I build scalable systems that bridge the gap between complex data analysis and production-grade software, with experience spanning **Bioinformatics**, **Quantitative Finance**, and **Computer Vision**.
