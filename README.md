# Hi there, I'm Siddhant Choudhary! 👋

### 🎓 Computer Science & Data Science @ UW-Madison

I am a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing a double major in **Computer Science** and **Data Science**. having lived in **six different countries**, I bring a unique global perspective to solving technical problems. My primary focus lies at the intersection of **Fintech**, **Financial Infrastructure**, and **Applied AI**.

I am passionate about building systems that automate complex workflows and using data to drive decision-making in financial markets and healthcare.
